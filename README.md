## Install

```
// yarn
yarn add react-grand-tour

// npm
npm install -S react-grand-tour
```

## Why
Some applications can get really complicated a feature rich, making them hard for new users to pick up and use effectively.

**If only there was a way of making that process easier ðŸ¤”**

Use ReactGrandTour to give  your users a quick tour around your application. Highlighting core features and screen regions along the way.

> Disclaimer. Safari does not support smooth scrolling to dom elements yet, so scrolling happens immediately. Other browsers which do support smooth scrolling to dom elements gently scroll between each step. 
> 
> Modals which track fast moving objects have also been slowed down in Safari because it cannot handle rapidly repositioning dom elements smoothly.

## Demo

You can also override the custom components which make up the touring overlay.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Steps = [
    {
        selector: `#first-step`,
        content: 'Welcome to React Grand Tour. This is my first tour step!',
    },
]

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <ReactGrandTour steps={Steps}>
            <App />
        </ReactGrandTour>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
);

const App = () => {
    const { open } = useGrandTour();

    return (
        <div>
            <div>
                <button onClick={open}>Open Tour</button>
            </div>
